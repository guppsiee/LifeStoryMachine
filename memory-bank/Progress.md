# Project Progress

## ✅ Step 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

This step has been completed.

- A new Next.js project has been initialized.
- Database connection to MongoDB has been configured.
- Environment variables for external APIs (OpenAI, Resend) have been set up.

## ✅ Step 2: Authentication and Database Implementation

This step has been completed.

- `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `bcryptjs` have been installed.
- A user schema has been defined in `models/user.js`.
- An API route for user registration has been created at `app/api/auth/register/route.js`.

## ✅ Step 3: Frontend Development

This step has been completed.

- A reusable `AuthForm` component has been created for login and registration.
- A registration page (`/register`) and a login page (`/login`) have been created, and they now properly handle authentication and redirection.
- A `RecordingComponent` has been created with UI elements for starting and stopping recording.
- The main app page (`app/app/page.js`) has been updated with a new UI, including "Generate Story" and "Reset Session" buttons, and a transcript display area.
- The `RecordingComponent` is now used on the main app page.

## ✅ Step 4 & 5: Backend Processing 

This step has been completed.

- The `openai` and `resend` npm packages have been installed.
- A new `sessionHistory` model has been created to store transcript segments.
- The `process-segment` API route now saves transcript segments to the database.
- The frontend now displays the session history and allows the user to reset it.
- A new `generate-story` API route has been created to generate a story from the session history, email it to the user, and clear the session.

## ✅ Step 6: UI Enhancements

This step has been completed.

- A custom color palette has been defined in `tailwind.config.js` and applied throughout the application.
- The `lucide-react` icon library has been installed and icons have been added to buttons.
- The overall UI has been polished with consistent styling and improved visual feedback.
- Browser `alert()` notifications have been replaced with `react-hot-toast` for a better user experience.
