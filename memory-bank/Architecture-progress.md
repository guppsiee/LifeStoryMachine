# Architecture Progress

## Foundational Architecture in Place

The initial architecture has been implemented, providing a solid foundation for the project.

- The Next.js project is set up with the App Router.
- The backend is ready to handle API requests.
- The system is configured to use OpenAI for STT and LLM services and Resend for email.

## Authentication and Database Schema

- **`models/user.js`**: Defines the `User` schema using Mongoose. It includes fields for `email` and a hashed `password`, ensuring that user data is structured and validated before being stored in MongoDB.

- **`app/api/auth/register/route.js`**: This API route provides the backend logic for user registration. It handles incoming `POST` requests, validates the data, hashes the password for security, and creates a new user in the database.

## Frontend Components

- **`app/components/AuthForm.js`**: A reusable client component that provides the UI for both registration and login. It includes fields for email and password, a submit button, and handles basic form state and error display.

- **`app/register/page.js`** and **`app/login/page.js`**: These pages implement the `AuthForm` component to create the registration and login experiences. They contain the logic for handling form submissions and routing.

- **`app/components/RecordingComponent.js`**: The core UI for the application's main feature. It includes a "Start/Stop Recording" button, a status message display, and a visual recording indicator, providing a user-friendly interface for capturing audio.

- **`app/page.js`**: The main landing page of the application, which has been updated to prominently feature the `RecordingComponent`.
